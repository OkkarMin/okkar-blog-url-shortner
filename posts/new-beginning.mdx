# New Beginning

[So begins a new age of knowledge](https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Invoker/Responses) Line that Invoker, character from Dota2 mutter and it just seemed like the correct phrase for me to put it in my first blog post as well.

Okay, so I've just started my new portfolio site (yay to me! ðŸŽ‰) that will allow me to showcase my:

- Bio
- Experience and
- Projects

[The old site](https://okkarmin.github.io) that was on github pages did the same but with this new site I wanted the following extra functionalities:

- Blog
- Custom domain (okkarm.in)
- URL shortener with custom domain ([okkarm.in/linkedin](https://okkarm.in/linkedin) âž¡ linkedin.com/in/okarmin/)
- Dashboard to
  - track number of clicks each shortened URL achieve
  - add new shortened URL
- Guestbook (recall those blog on the blogger.com that had a chat box by the side? Something like that so that visitors can leave a message. BUT, letting public users input text to my site is another headache, I need to sanitize and validate the inputs)

I've been building the site for 2 weeks and I was able to accomplish majority except the followings:

- Blog works but I still have to figure out how to style code written in MarkDown to show up on the site
- Tracking of number of clicks works but there is no Dashboard on my site
- Adding of new links works but have to manually go to firebase to add it in

and of course I will slowly style the site to my heart content. Still not fully satisfied with the current style.

## Public Commit

I've read over and over that comitting publicly will help will achieving a goal that you have planned. Never had a platform to commit publicly, so here goes my public commit:

1. I am going to work on a project with a friend of mine and we are going to use documentation tools and kanban tools this will be a great opportunity to learn more about using collaboration tools such as Confluence and Jira that are heavily used in the industry
2. I am going to obtain AWS Solution Architect Professional Certificate by end of this year. It is expensive US$300. Thankfully I obtained my Solution Architect Associate during my internship at AWS and it was fully paid for by AWS
3. I am going to do one commit a day for my projects, no matter how small or big, one commit a day for my projects. I can easily track this by looking at [my github profile page](https://okkarm.in/github), commit board. This is what it looks like now and I want to fully fill it with green squares

## Next Task

I am going to have to figure out how to style code blocks on my site and I am going to release a blog post on building your own custom domain URL shortener ðŸ˜Š
